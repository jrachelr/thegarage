CarCar is an app comprised of three microservices: Inventory, Sales and Services. The aggregate root of CarCar is Inventory as the bounded contexts of Sales and Services is based on data in the Inventory microservice. 

The microservices communicate via a poller. The sales microservice polls for value objects based on the automobile model in Inventory. 

The inventory API runs on port 8100. 
URLS to access the inventory API:
- http://localhost:8100/api/manufacturers/
- http://localhost:8100/api/models/
- http://localhost:8100/api/automobiles/

# API Endpoints
## Service microservice

The service microservice has three models:
- AutomobileVO:
This is a value object which polls VIN from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice. It is used to evaluate if a specific vehicle get VIP treatment at CarCar.

- Technician:
This is a simple model that contains the name and employee number of a techinician. An Employee number is unique to each technician. User can create a new technician on the webpage with just a name.

- ServiceAppoinment:
This is a model contains VIN, customer name, scheduled time, reason for visit, and technician(a foreign key) for an appointment. This model also indicates whether an appointment is finished, and whether the vehicle gets VIP treatment with two boolean properties named 'finsihed' and 'VIP_treatment".


The service poller:
- a poller to use to integrate with Inventory, specifically the Automobile modle

## Sales microservice

The Sales microservice is an API that exists within a bounded context tied to the Inventory API. The purpose of the application is to allow tracking of sale transaction data. This is achieved through a number of components: 
* Potential customer tracking
* Sales representative tracking
* Transaction history 
    * Total transactions
    * By sales representative
* Ability to create new sale transaction records
    * When a new sale record is created the associated Automobile is marked as sold and no longer appears in the select dropdown of the create sale record form.

### Models
The sales microservice uses four models:
* AutomobileVO - a value object representing an individual vehicle. This data is obtained via a poller from the inventory microservice. 
    * A unique VIN number.
    * A boolean field indicating if the automobile has been sold.
* SalesPerson - an entity.
    * Name of the sales person. 
    * A unique employee ID.
* Customer - an entity.
    * Name of customer.
    * Address.
    * Phone number. 
* SalesRecord - a value object. 
    * Automobile - a Foreign Key representing an instance of the AutomobileVO'.
    * Sales person - a Foreign Key representing the SalesPerson
    * Customer - a Foreign Key representing the Customer. 
    * Price

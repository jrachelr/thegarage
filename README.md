CarCar is an app comprised of three microservices: Inventory, Sales and Services. The aggregate root of CarCar is Inventory as the bounded contexts of Sales and Services is based on data in the Inventory microservice. 

The microservices communicate via a poller. The sales microservice polls for value objects based on the automobile model in Inventory.

# API Endpoints
## Service microservice

The service microservice has three models:
- AutomobileVO:
This is a value object which polls VIN from the Automobile model in the Inventory microservice. It is used to evaluate if a specific vehicle get VIP treatment at CarCar.

- Technician:

- ServiceAppoinment:
This is a model contains VIN, customer name, scheduled time, reason for visit, and technician(a foreign key) for an appointment. This model also indicates whether an appointment is finished, and whether the vehicle gets VIP treatment with two boolean properties named 'finsihed' and 'VIP_treatment".


The service poller:
- a poller to use to integrate with Inventory, specifically the Automobile modle

## Sales microservice

The Sales microservice is an API that exists within a bounded context tied to the Inventory API. The purpose of the application is to allow tracking of sale transaction data. This is achieved through a number of components: 
* Potential customer tracking
* Sales representative tracking
* Transaction history 
    * Total transactions
    * By sales representative
* Ability to create new transactions

### Models
The sales microservice uses four models:
* AutomobileVO - a value object representing an individual vehicle
* SalesPerson
* Customer
* SalesRecord
 
 ### Poller

 

The sales microservice uses the RESTful API to handle automobile service appointments.
